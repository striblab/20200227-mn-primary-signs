      <p>As Minnesotans prepare to select their preference for Democratic presidential nominee on Super Tuesday on March 3, several signs point toward strong showings for the state's own U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Vermont's U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders.</p>

      <p>Klobuchar's homefield advantage in Minnesota may be challenged by Sanders as he attempts to repeat his success here after an overwhelming caucus victory in 2016 against Hillary Clinton.</p>

      <p>As with many states, Minnesota's 75 pledged national delegates will be assigned proportionally according to the popular vote across its eight congressional districts. So even a second place finish may prove vital to candidates trying to stay afloat on a day with a third of Democratic delegates at stake.</p>

      <p>Here's where various data-driven signs are pointing for Minnesota this coming Tuesday:</p>
  </section>

  <div class=""rule""></div>
  <section class=""container-lg"">
      <h2 class=""chartTitle"">Polls lean toward Klobuchar</h2>
      <p>The most recent <a href=""http://www.startribune.com/star-tribune-mpr-news-minnesota-poll-results-democratic-primary-klobuchar-sanders-warren-buttigieg-biden/567940781/"">Star Tribune/MPR News Minnesota Poll</a> places Klobuchar ahead of Sanders among Minnesotans.</p>
      
      <p>Behind them is U.S. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden. Notably, about 21 percent of the 500 surveyed likely Democratic primary voters were still undecided.</p>

      <section class=""container-lg"">
        <p><a href=""https://www.uml.edu/docs/2020-MN-topline_tcm18-322443.pdf"" target=""new_"">Another poll</a> from University of Massachusettes Lowell from earlier this month puts Klobuchar at 27 percent, six points ahead of Sanders, with Warren and Buttigieg in distant tow.</p>

        <p>Polling ahead of Minnesota's primary has <a href=""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/minnesota/"" target=""new_"">otherwise been sparse</a>, with most surveys of the state dating back to last summer and autumn.</p>
    </section>


    <div class=""rule""></div>
    <section class=""container-lg"">
        <h2 class=""chartTitle"">Forecasters show a Klobuchar/Sanders tie</h2>
        <p><a href=""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/minnesota/"" target=""new_"">FiveThirtyEight's Democratic primary forecast</a> gives Klobuchar and Sanders similar chances – about 48 percent – of winning the most votes and delegates in Minnesota.</p>

        <p>The model used to favor Sanders' chances in Minnesota, but Klobuchar's projected performance strengthed as more data became available. On average, the two candidates are predicted to basically split the state's delegate count.</p>

    </div>

    <section class=""container-lg"">
      <p>Since delegates are awarded proportionally based on the popular vote, a slight lead for either candidate would still lead to a statistical tie.</p>
    </section>

   
  <div class=""rule""></div>
  <section class=""container-lg"">
    <h2 class=""chartTitle"">Google searches show interest in Sanders</h2>
    <p>Among the top five Democratic candidates, Sanders strongly leads in Google search term rankings leading into Super Tuesday, with Klobuchar and others far behind him.</p>

    <p>Google search data have seemed somewhat correlated to results, as Sanders <a href=""https://bit.ly/36L9CFW"">led search trends before Minnesota's caucus in 2016</a>. He also ranked highly among Minnesota searches <a href=""http://www.startribune.com/minnesotans-googled-these-democratic-candidates-the-most-in-2019/506439501/"">throughout last year</a>.</p>

    <h2 class=""chartTitle"">Campaign donations surge for Sanders</h2>
    <p>While Klobuchar consistently lead fundraising in her own backyard throughout 2019, Sanders slightly overtook her in January among ActBlue donations and vastly lead the field in individual donors.</p>

    <p>Klobuchar still leads Minnesota fundraising with about $4.1 million, doubling Sanders' statewide totals so far. But fundraising momentum appeared to back Sanders headed into February.</p>

      </div>

      <section class=""container-lg"">
        <p>Nationwide, Sanders leads among individual donors, finishing 2019 with 1.4 million unique individuals contributing to his campaign, well ahead of everyone <a href=""http://www.startribune.com/klobuchar-among-candidates-whose-bank-accounts-are-low-headed-into-february-races/568089662/"">including Klobuchar</a>.</p>
        
        <p>This trend holds up in Minnesota, signalling strong grassroots support across the state, with most of his donors giving less than $200.</p>
      </section>

      </div>

      <p>When mapped, Klobuchar's donors outnumber her rivals in many rural counties, but Sanders takes the top spot in most of the seven-county Twin Cities metro area, the key region to electoral victory in Minnesota.</p>
